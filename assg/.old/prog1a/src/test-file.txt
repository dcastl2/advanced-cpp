People are often unreasonable, 
Illogical, and self-centered;
Forgive them anyway.

  If you are kind, people may accuse you 
  Of selfish, ulterior motives;
  Be kind anyway.

If you are successful, you will win 
False friends, and true enemies;
Succeed anyway.

  If you are honest and forthright, 
  People may cheat you;
  Be honest and forthright anyway.

What you spend years building, 
Could be destroyed overnight;
Build anyway.

  If you find serenity and happiness, 
  Others may be jealous;
  Be happy anyway.

The good you do today, 
May by tomorrow be forgetten;
Do good anyway.

  Give the world the best you have, 
  Though it may never be enough;
  Give it the best you have anyway.

You see, in the final analysis, it is about you and the meaning of your life;
                                              It was never about them anyway.

                 home for children in Calcutta; original by Dr. Kent M. Keith
