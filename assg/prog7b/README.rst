EC Homework 7
=============

**Note**: This is the last extra credit assignment.  This assignment is due
Sunday, 12/11/16 at 6:00 PM (three weeks from the assigned date), and there is
no initiative bonus this time.  Instead, the cap has increased to +16.


1. More video games. 
     [+16] Create a video game of any genre. You will be awarded a number of
     points proportional to the effort you put in, as measured by line count,
     artistic quality, code aesthetics, complexity of logic, and cleanliness
     of design.
     
     The only other essential restriction is that it be object-oriented; it
     must make use of C++ classes.  You can extend a previous video game you
     were working on, but you will have to translate it into an object-oriented
     version first.  If you are extending a previous object-oriented work, add
     functionality to make it fuller-featured.

     Make it good.  +16 is reserved for ambitious, top-notch projects.


2. C++ graphics programming with SFML.
      [+16] You will need to exercise a lot of independence for this.  You'll
      need to have your own install of Linux and be able to debug your own
      Linux and g++ issues.

       If you have your own Linux setup, install the ``g++`` and
       ``libsfml-dev`` packages.  Then clone my sfml-examples repository from
       my GitHub and run the ``Makefile`` in it.  Examine the sources and the
       executables to see how the SFML library works.  You can view the SFML
       tutorial on-line for more information.

       Then, write four (4) screensaver-like animations using SFML.  You can
       get jump-started from my example codes, but your final products **must
       be fundamentally different from my examples** [-16].  These are worth +4
       a piece.


3. LaTeX for data structures.
     [+16] If you have enjoyed LaTeX and want to become a LaTeX wizard, then
     you can LaTeX notes for the data structures segment of the course.  Write
     notes for:
     
       * ``lists.tex`` for linked lists
       * ``stacks.tex`` for stacks
       * ``queues.tex`` for queues 
       * ``trees.tex`` for trees

      Include a ``Makefile`` as well.  These are +4 a piece.  They should be
      around 3-4 pages each, and contain an overview (purpose of and uses for
      the data structure), the member function codes, thorough explanations of
      those codes, and theoretical discussion (time complexity of the
      functions, what is and is not possible).  Each document should contain at
      least one illustration of the data structure (use a PostScript document
      for this). 

      If your notes for a given data structure are the best out of all those
      turned in, I will re-use them for the future and credit you for them.


4. Something else.
      [+16] If you have something specific you want to do for a final project
      that would further your career and/or academic goals, then propose it to
      me in-person and I will negotiate a problem specification with you.  The
      scope and complexity of the work should be at the same level as any of
      the above problems.  Be specific in your proposal.
