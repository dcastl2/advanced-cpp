Here are some resources to help you:

  * ``color.h`` is a header file which can be included to support color output
  of text to ANSI color-enabled terminals.  To use it, you will need to copy it
  to the directory in which you write your code and use it as an include (as
  per a #include directive).

  * ``color.cpp`` is an elementary code example of how to use the above header
  file.

  * ``color-drawing.cpp`` is an example of a color drawing which you might do
  if you choose the color drawing problem.

  * ``ascii-font-color.cpp`` is an example of how to create an ASCII font 
  which prints out horizontally and in color.  It's an example of more
  intermediate programming which can help jog your memory.

  * ``asciimation.cpp`` is an example ASCII animation you may be interested
  in if you choose the animation problem.

  * ``ctime.cpp`` shows how to use the ctime library for dealing with time.

  * ``clock.cpp`` is an example of how to print a digital clock showing the
  current time.  It uses the ctime library.

  * ``hello-writer.cpp`` is a program which writes a "Hello, world!" program.
  You may draw ideas from this if you choose the code template problem.

  * ``test-file.txt`` is a file for testing with.

  * ``typeout.cpp`` shows how to type out text with cout and stream flushing.
