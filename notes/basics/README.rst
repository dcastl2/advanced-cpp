This lesson gives an overview of basic codes and structures which you will
need to have down before committing to the course.  This is what the
preliminary test will cover.

You'll want to read the codes in the following order:

  * ``hello.cpp``: you will need to know it.

  * ``sum.cpp``: look at this for review of a for-loop. This is a basic
    control structure that you'll need to have mastered by this point.

  * ``vocabulary.cpp`` for terminology; it's important to know terms
    when communicating about code.

  * ``min.cpp`` for a basic search-like operation on an array.

  * ``reverse.cpp`` for a more intermediate application on an array,
    (in this case, a string).  You'll need to be comfortable with
    the ``std::string`` type for the preliminary. 

  * ``multi-table.cpp`` for a nested loop.
