% Body
\begin{document}

The most basic \LaTeX\ document simply contains a documentclass command to
indicate that an article is being created, then a begin document command to
start the body of the document. Inside the body goes the markup.  Each
paragraph is separated by a newline, and is automatically indented.  The \LaTeX\ 
language supports commands for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{bold}, 
  \item \emph{emphasis},
  \item \texttt{teletype}, 
\end{itemize}

and other font attributes.  With regex substitutions, it's very easy to change
things such as font attributes throughout the document.  Here are some
built-in documentclasses:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item report
  \item article
  \item slides
  \item book 
  \item letter
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
