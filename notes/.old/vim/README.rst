The .vimrc file
===============

To enable the options in the vimrc file, cp the file to your home directory.
If you are in the same directory as the vimrc, do:

  ``cp vimrc ~/.vimrc``

The next time you load vim, the options should be set. You may add your own
abbreviations to this file to speed up your programming. Be careful of
abbreviating too much, because you *do* still have to write out code on tests,
and you benefit from practice. Only abbreviate something once you have mastered
the syntax for it.
