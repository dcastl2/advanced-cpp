Flowcharts
==========

We can use a diagram called a **flowchart** to analyze what is called **control
flow** in a program.  This shows the exact steps in program execution. There
are three main symbols used in flowcharts:

  diamond - conditional
  rectangle - statement
  parallelogram - i/o

What follows is a flowchart of a double-for loop that calculates a double-sum.
