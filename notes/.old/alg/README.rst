* ``big-O.rst`` contains notes on Big-O notation.

* ``sum.cpp`` gives an elementary example of efficient vs. inefficient
  summation algorithms.

* ``metrics.cpp`` shows how to add metrics to codes to identify how
  many operations the codes take up.

* ``examples.cpp`` contains examples of codes; you are invited to 
  identify the space and time complexity of these codes.

* ``efficiency.cpp`` gives inefficient codes, and invites you to
  make these more efficient by changing up the logic.
