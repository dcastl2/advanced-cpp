Submission Instructions
=======================

For any given assignment, where the assignment number is N (for example, 1, 2,
...), create a folder called progN in your home directory, then place all your
codes within that directory.  For example, for ``prog1a``, create a folder
``prog1a`` to put your codes into.  Note that if you create subdirectories
within ``prog1a``, their contents will *not* be copied. Anything else placed
within the ``prog1a`` directory will be copied.

To submit progN, run the command

 ``~dcastl2/bin/p_copy N``

For example, if you are submitting ``prog1a``, run

 ``~dcastl2/bin/p_copy 1a``

and the files will be submitted. Each submission receives a timestamp. The
timestamp will always reflect your *last* submission.
