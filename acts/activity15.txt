5. Write a recursive method ``int TreeNode::size()`` to calculate how many
   TreeNodes are contained within.
   





























6. Write a recursive method ``int TreeNode::height()`` to calculate the 
   height of the tree.































7. Write a recursive function ``int trace(int **A, int n)`` to calculate
   the sum of the diagonal of an n-by-n matrix.

























8. Write a recursive function ``void print(string s, int i)`` with
   an overloaded wrapper function ``void print(string s)`` to print
   the string s backwards.  To achieve this, you must print the
   characters upon unwinding the stack.
