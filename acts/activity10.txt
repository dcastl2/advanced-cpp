1. Write the function ``Node *Node::rRotate(int k)``, which right-rotates a
linked list by k elements.




























   
2. Write the function ``void Stack::downRotate()`` to move the node on the
bottom of a stack to the top.































3. Write the function ``Stack *Stack::reverse()`` to return a pointer to
the reverse of a stack. It must not destroy the original.


























4. Write the function ``void Stack::upRotate(int k)`` to up-rotate the stack
by k elements.
