1.  Answer the following. (a) What is the purpose of algorithm analysis? 
    (b) Define big-O notation.  (c) What is time complexity?  (d) What is 
    space complexity?




























2.  Write the code ``float euler()``, which should calculate Euler's number.
    Euler's number is equal to the infinite sum of 1/n! for n=0 to infinity,
    but it is sufficient to stop at n=50 for floating-point precision.






























3.  Write the code ``std::string trim(std::string s)`` to return the string s
    trimmed of all whitespace, which includes spaces, tabs, and newlines.


























4.  Write the code ``int digs(int n)`` to calculate the number of digits in the
    integer n.  For example digs(2357) should return 4, since 2357 has 4 digits.
    Account for the fact that 0 is single-digit, thus digs(0) should return 1.
