1.  Answer the following:  (a) What are two universal, invariant rules of
    documentation and style?  Explain why these are necessary.
    
























2.  Write a code that calculates ``float sqrt(float n)``, without invoking
    the sqrt function from math. It should be accurate within 1e-2, such that
    if your answer is x, then abs(n-x*x) < 1e-2.

    
































3.  Write a full header, library source, Makefile, and demonstration code for
    the functions ``int mth::sum(int n)`` and ``int mth::factorial(int n)``.
    Implement the most efficient versions of these functions.
