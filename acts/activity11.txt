1. What is recursion?  What is a base case and a recursive case?
   What is infinite recursion and how does it relate to the base
   case of a recursive code?
 
2. (a) Give one unique application of recursion.  (b) How do the
   space and time complexities of a recursive code compare to that
    of an iterative code?  (c)  What is the function stack?

3. Write the recursive function ``int digital(int n)`` to calculate
   the digital sum of n. The digital sum of an integer is the sum
   of its digits, recursively applied until a single-digit result
   is reached.  E.g. the first-level digital sum of 1236 is 
   1+2+3+6 which is 12, then the second-level digital sum is 1+2=3,
   so the final result is 3.

 4. Write the recursive function ``float golden(int n)``, which
    calculates the golden ratio to n iterations.
