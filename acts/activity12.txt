1. What is a binary search tree?  Give an example of something in the
   real world that the BST can be used to represent.
 




























2. Write a recursive code ``int pow(int a, int n)`` to calculate
   a^n recursively.































3. Write the recursive function ``int lucas(int n)`` to calculate
   the nth Lucas number, which is defined by

     l(0) = 2
     l(n) = f(n-1) + f(n+1)

   Write also recursive function ``int fib(int n)`` also, where 
   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, and f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).  




















4. Write the function ``int TreeNode::sum()`` to sum the keys inside
   a subtree of a BST.
