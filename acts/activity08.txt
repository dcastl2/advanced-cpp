1. What is polymorphism? What are the three types of polymorphism? What
   is it useful for?





























2. Write a full C++ program which overloads the functions ``int sum(int n)`` 
   and ``int sum(int a, int b)``. Your main function should demonstrate
   the use of both of these.





























3. Assuming that you have the following struct, write a function that overloads
   the multiplication operator (*).
   
   struct imag {
     int a;
     int b;
   };






















4. Write a generic function ``int dot(T *a, T *b, int n)`` which calculates the
   dot product of two arrays of any type.
