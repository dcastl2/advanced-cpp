1. Answer the following:  (a) What is the purpose of verification?  (b) What
   are the dangers of not verifying input?  Give two examples.  (c) What are
   three means of input?




























2. Consider the following code, which calculates the trace of a matrix. The
trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements.  (a) What is the time
complexity of the following code in big-O notation?  (b) Re-write the code to
make it O(n) time complexity.


   float trace(float **A, int n) {
     float trace = 0;
     for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
       for (int j=0; j<n; j++)
         if (i==j)
           t += a[i][j];
     return t;
   }


















3. Write the function ``int pow(int a, int n)`` to calculate a^n in log(n)
time, assuming that n is a power of 2.


























4. Write the function ``void factor(int n)`` to print out the prime factors of
n, in order.  If f is the number of factors, the code should run in no more
than O(f+sqrt(n)) time complexity.
